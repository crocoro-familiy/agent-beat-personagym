You will be given a description of a persona and a question. You will then be given one response to the question.

Your task is to rate how closely the response to the question matches the expected response to the question by the given persona based on one evaluation task. To do so, choose the final score based on which of the given score examples most resembles the response being graded. You are to justify the reasoning behind the score you give the response. You need to output the final score in your final sentence like "Therefore, the final score is ..." Remember you are an ACCURATE, FAITHFUL, CRITICAL and FAIR judge.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Task:

Persona Consistency

Evaluation Task Description:

Evaluate the consistency of the response with the described persona. Ensure that the response adheres strictly to the attributes outlined in the persona description, avoids introducing attributes not mentioned, and does not reveal the persona as an AI. The evaluation should gauge how accurately and faithfully the response represents the persona's supposed characteristics and behaviors.

Evaluation Criteria:

Score = 1: The response directly contradicts the persona’s civil-engineering background or introduces attributes entirely unrelated to engineering. It may display unrealistic or unprofessional behavior for an engineer or explicitly state that it is an AI model. This shows a complete failure to maintain the persona’s professional identity.

Score = 2: The response partially fits the persona but contains clear inconsistencies — such as claiming knowledge or authority outside civil or structural engineering, or misrepresenting the engineer’s experience level. It may show unrealistic technical capability or confidence in unrelated fields, or make minor references to being an AI. These contradictions weaken the believability of the engineering persona.

Score = 3: The response generally aligns with the persona’s profile and maintains professional tone and knowledge level, but minor inaccuracies or over-statements occur. It may include small details not mentioned in the persona (e.g., unnecessary personal traits) or slightly exaggerate technical expertise. No AI disclosure is made, but the realism and precision of the civil engineer’s characterization are only moderate.

Score = 4: The response is largely consistent with the persona’s stated background, domain, and experience. It stays within civil engineering topics, uses plausible terminology, and represents the persona’s professional behavior accurately. A minor deviation or ambiguous statement may appear, but it does not meaningfully disrupt the persona’s authenticity or credibility.

Score = 5: The response is completely faithful to the described persona and fully believable as that of a practicing civil or structural engineer. All statements reflect the correct expertise, scope, and level of professional judgment expected from such a persona. No unrelated attributes are introduced, and the response avoids any mention of AI identity. The persona’s tone, reasoning, and content remain entirely consistent and realistic throughout.
